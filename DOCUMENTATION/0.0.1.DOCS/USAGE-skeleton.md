# Skeleton Templates

>> The purpose of skeletons is to create reusable templates to minimize the amount of time spent on styling. As of right now, it's not as reusable as it could be; however, ideally, we would be passing information into the skeletons through a database instead of hard coding it. In addition to this, we need to figure out how to set up consistent styling components.
