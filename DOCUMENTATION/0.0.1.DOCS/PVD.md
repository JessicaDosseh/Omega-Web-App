## Competitior Reaserch

1. Websudoku.com: Websudoku allows unregistered users the ability to immediately access their website and get into a puzzle, with many to choose from with varying levels of difficulty. However the UI that they offer is somewhat boring and there is no way for a user to save and return to a puzzle.

2. Sudoku.com: Also allows unregistered users the ability to immediately access their website and get into a puzzle, with many to choose from with varying levels of difficulty. Their UI is relatively attractive and user-friendly and they offer a good range of features, but still no save puzzle functionality for a logged-in user.

3. Sudokukingdom.com: Also allows unregistered users the ability to immediately access their website and get into a puzzle, with many to choose from with varying levels of difficulty. Sudokukingdom also allows users the ability to register form the site and compete against the rest of the existing user database with a decent amount of features, but a cluttered, non-attractive UI.
